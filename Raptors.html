             <p> Among the most feared dinosaurs of prehistoric times, raptors were closely related to modern birds, and counted among the dino-birds listed above. Raptors were distinguished by their bipedal postures, grasping, three-fingered hands, larger-than-average brains, and the signature, curved claws on each of their feet; most of them were also covered with feathers. Among the most famous raptors were Deinonychus, Velociraptor and the giant Utahraptor. </p>
